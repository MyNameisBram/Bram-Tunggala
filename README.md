# What people say about Bram:  
His wife says he's a loving husband, his son says he's a compassionate father (in baby language of course), his parents would say he's a respectful son, his simblings would say he's a risk taker, his friends would say he's encouraging and loyal, his ex-empolyers/peers would says he's a diligent worker, and he would say he's a dreamer and has an optimistic outlook on life.  

### What does Bram like to do? 
- run around chasing his 7 month old son Max, who crawls really really really fast
- drink beer with his beautiful wife Emily and play devil's advocate even though he agrees with her 99% of the time
- having friends over, smoking meat on his big green egg and starting a conversation with... remember the time when... 
- golfing, then contemplating on why he still plays because he's not very good at it
- hanging out at the YMCA outdoor pool watching his son dip his face in the water and regretting it, then repeating a hundred more times because... babies right? 

### Virtures he strives to live by: 
- Empathy - Golden Rule “Treat others the way you want to be treated” 
- Decisive - perform without fail what you resolve (what you set out to do)
- Peaceful - don’t be disturbed at unimportant things, or at random accidents
