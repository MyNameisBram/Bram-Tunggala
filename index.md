# About
Bram was born in Jakarta, Indonesia and moved to suburbs of Atlanta when he was 7 years old. He now lives in almost Decatur with his wife, 7 month old son, and their cat Hodor. 

### What people say about Bram:  
His wife says he's a loving husband, his son would say he's a compassionate father (in baby language of course), his parents would say he's a respectful son, his simblings would say he's a risk taker, his friends would say he's encouraging and loyal, his ex-empolyers/peers would says he's a diligent worker, and he would say he's a dreamer and has an optimistic outlook on life.  

### What does Bram like to do? 
- run around chasing his 7 month old son, who crawls really really really fast
- drink beer with his beautiful wife and play devil's advocate even though he agrees with her 99% of the time
- having friends over, smoking meat on his big green egg and starting a conversation with... remember the time when... 
- golfing, then contemplating on why he still plays because he's not very good at it
- hanging out at the YMCA outdoor pool watching his son dip his face in the water and regretting it, then repeating a hundred more times because... babies right? 

### Virtures to live by: 
- Empathy - Golden Rule “Treat others the way you want to be treated” 
- Decisive - perform without fail what you set out to do
- Peaceful - don’t be disturbed at unimportant things, or at random accidents

>> *"He is comfortable presenting new ideas to a large team and is also comfortable and excels at client relations.  Bram doesn’t shy away from challenges and stops for feedback along the way.  He is extremely effective at making processes – in several areas of a company – more efficient.  He stays ahead of the curve in technology, and often implemented processes in this arena that made the day to day operations smoother and time-efficient."*
